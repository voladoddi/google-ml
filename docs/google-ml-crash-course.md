1. ML concepts

[A] Framing ML 
- Labels : 
- Features : 
- Examples :
  - Labeled example
  - Unlabeled example 
- Models : 
  - Training a model
  - Inference
- Regression vs Classification :

[B] Descending into ML 
- Linear Regression : 
  - The line that models the relationship between input feature (x) and target (y). 
  - This can be represented as a line => y = mx + c , which in ML convention becomes y = b + wx.
  - There can be several input features x1, x2, and x3 ... in which case line => y = b + wx1 + wx2 + ... wxn.
- Loss : 
  - L2 Loss : represents the squared error, where error is (y' - y) i.e. (predicted - target values).
